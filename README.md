_Keywords: causal broadcast, reliable broadcast, complexity trade-off, large
and dynamic systems_

Beamer slides of the presentation made during
[OPODIS'18](https://opodis2018.comp.polyu.edu.hk/). It's about a causal
broadcast implementation that provides a new trade-off between speed, traffic,
and memory. Most importantly, this causal broadcast is able to remove all and only
obsolete control information about broadcast messages. The space consumed by each
process increases and decreases over receipts. The paper is available
[here](https://github.com/parchemins/paper-prcbroadcast-tex).
